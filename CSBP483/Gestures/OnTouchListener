A "touch gesture" occurs when a user places one or more fingers on the touch screen, and your application interprets that pattern of touches as a particular gesture.
Android provides special types of touch screen events such as 
pinch 
double tap, 
scrolls , 
long presses and 
Flinch, 
flinging 
    These are all known as gestures.
